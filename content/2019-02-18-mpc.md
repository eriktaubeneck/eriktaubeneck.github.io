## Building a Secret Machine

So what is secure multi-party computation (MPC) anyways? (And, yes, the secure does somehow get dropped from the acronym.) First, we need a few different parties; let's consider Alice, Bob, Carol, and Steve. In general, we'll have $m$ parties.

Formally, MPC is defined as

$$ f(s_1, s_2, ..., s_n) = p $$

where $f$ is an arbitrary function, $s_i$ is a secret input, and $p$ is a public output. $n$ is just the sum of the cardinality of each parties secret inputs, but there is no requirement that they have the same number of secret inputs.

A secret input is simply a value which only a single party knows. To formalize it, first let $s_i \in \mathbb{F}$ where $\mathbb{F}$ is some field. Now, WLOG, let $s_i$ belong to Alice. We're also going to assume that all participants have access to a random number generator which gives them a random element of $\mathbb{F}$. Alice now generates $m-1$ such random numbers, $\{r_1, ..., r_{m-1}\}$, and then assigns $r_m = s_i - (r_1 + ... + r_{m-1})$. Note that

$$ s_i = \sum_{j=1}^m r_j. $$

We can then define an additive secret share $\left \langle s_i \right \rangle$ of $s_i$ as the representation $(r_1, ..., r_m)$, with one $r_i$ given to each participant. Note that because each $r_i$ is a random element chosen uniformly from a finite field $\mathbb{F}$, no participant learns any information about $s_i$.

Given any $r \in \mathbb{F}$ and a randomly generated $r_k \in \mathbb{F}$ we know that

$$ P(r_k = r) = \frac{1}{\left \vert \mathbb{F} \right \vert} $$

We know that $\{r_i, ..., r_{m-1}\}$ are random (by definition), but we want to show that $r_m$ is also random, i.e.

$$ P(r_m = r) = \frac{1}{\left \vert \mathbb{F} \right \vert}. $$

First, note that

$$ P(r_m = r) = P(s_i - \sum_{j=1}^{m-1} r_j = r). $$

We will first need a lemma that the sum of two random elements is also random:

### Lemma
$$ P(r_j + r_k = r) = \frac{1}{\left \vert \mathbb{F} \right \vert}. $$

### Proof of Lemma:

<!-- First, we'll show that the probability that two random numbers are the same is $\frac{1}{\left \vert \mathbb{F} \right \vert}.$ -->

<!-- $$ P(r_j = r_k) = \sum_{r=1}^{\left \vert \mathbb{F} \right \vert} P(r_j = r) * P(r_k = r) = {\left \vert \mathbb{F} \right \vert} * \frac{1}{\left \vert \mathbb{F} \right \vert * \left \vert \mathbb{F} \right \vert} = \frac{1}{\left \vert \mathbb{F} \right \vert}$$ -->

We wish to know

$$ P(r_j + r_k = r). $$

If we temporarily fix $r_k = r_f$, then since $r - r_f \in \mathbb{F}$ and $r_j$ is chosen uniformly,

$$ P(r_j + r_f = r) = P(r_j = r - r_f) = \frac{1}{\left \vert \mathbb{F} \right \vert}. $$

Then, if we iterate through all potential values of $r_f$,

$$ P(r_j + r_k = r) = \sum_{r_f = 1}^{\left \vert \mathbb{F} \right \vert} P(r_j + r_f = r) * P(r_k = r_f) = {\left \vert \mathbb{F} \right \vert} * \frac{1}{\left \vert \mathbb{F} \right \vert * \left \vert \mathbb{F} \right \vert} = \frac{1}{\left \vert \mathbb{F} \right \vert}$$

**End of Lemma**

Now, through induction it's obvious that this extends to the full sum, and we can simplify our original statement to (where $r_x$ is another random element with an unused index variable)

$$ P(r_m = r) = P(s_i - \sum_{j=1}^{m-1} r_j = r) = P(s_i - r_x = r) = P(r_x = s_i - r). $$

Since $s_i$ is fixed, this is clearly $\frac{1}{\left \vert \mathbb{F} \right \vert}$.  **QED**.

Blockchain, so hot right now. Okay, maybe [not quite as hot as a year ago](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-peaked-a-year-ago-heres-a-look-at-12-months-of-misery-2018-12-14), but over that last year I dove into the blockchain deep-end (research-wise - financially just dipping my toes.) Some of the ideas in the space are truly novel, such as proof-of-work as a way to achieve consensus of an immutable ledger, extending consensus to a distributed virtual machine, and verifying transactions anonymously though zero-knowledge proofs. Others take the form of "<existing startup> + blockchain" without much else.

Through this research, the

Despite it's obscenely verbose and quirky syntax, it was more than a breath of fresh air compared to Word's Equation Editor.
